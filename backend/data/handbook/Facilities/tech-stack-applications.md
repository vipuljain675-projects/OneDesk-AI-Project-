## Tech Stack Process Has Now Moved to Compass

**The entire Tech Stack management process has officially transitioned to Compass on Wednesday, October 22nd**.

- The [Tech Stack on Compass](https://app.serval.com/new-request) is where system information now lives. You can access Tech Stack from here - [Tech Stack](https://techstack.gtlb.com).

### Have an existing Merge Request?

- No need to worry. Depending on the progress, we will complete and replicate the change onto [Tech Stack](https://techstack.gtlb.com).

### Planning to Create a New Merge Request?

Please use the new **Tech Stack Update Form** instead of submitting an MR:

- Use the **[Tech Stack Update Form](https://app.serval.com/new-request)** in Compass:

## Definition and Access

The Tech Stack is a list of all the technology that GitLab currently uses to support the business. It includes systems, applications, tools, and data used across all departments, along with details such as the business purpose/description, owners, provisioners, access teams, and other relevant attributes.

The [Tech Stack](https://techstack.gtlb.com) is now the official single source of truth for all system information and changes. You can access it through:

- **Okta → Compass → New Request → Service Catalog → Tech Stack Update**
- By visiting [Tech Stack](https://techstack.gtlb.com).

Many applications have a **[Tech Stack Guide](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-guide/)** to help you understand how each app is used and implemented.

This [Jupyter Notebook view](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C0sikfvoY46p2-dbYNtHwo77VJLixCe2?usp=sharing) of the Tech Stack allows filtering and exporting CSV, JSON, or Markdown versions of the data.

## Roles and Responsibilities

|Role|Responsibilities|
|----------|------------------------------|
|Business and Technical Owners of Systems|Accountable for completeness and accuracy of Tech Stack data; Process [Tech Stack updates](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-applications/#tech-stack-updates); Primary contacts for system-related inquiries and administration.|
|IT Business Technology| Code Owners of Tech Stack; Advise Business and Technical Owners in supporting systems. |
|Security Risk|Help facilitate Tech Stack updates, including the [Business Impact Analysis](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/business-impact-analysis/) for new and existing systems.|

## Tech Stack Definitions

- **Business Owner**: The Business Owner is the individual(s) responsible for all budget and decision making around the tool. They should define how the tool is used and by whom. This person(s) usually has login access to the tool as `Owner` but login access isn't necessary in all cases. Please make sure you list individual people in this field, rather than teams.
- **Technical Owner**: This may be the same as the Business Owner based on the nature of the system, for instance, if the system isn't centrally managed and or/requires little to no configuration. For systems that are centrally managed and/or heavily configured, the Technical Owner is someone with understanding of the application's architecture, functionality (including types of data involved), and overall criticality/impact to GitLab. Technical Owner(s) are typically `administrators` of a tool. This includes everyone with the administrative clearance to provision and deprovision access of a tool and/or as the technical expertise needed to manage it.
- **Provisioner/Deprovisioner**: People in charge of granting and removing team member access to a tool. At least two provisioners/deprovisioners should be named for every tool in the handbook. Provisioners can be contacted as a group in Slack using the `@provisioners` handle and in GitLab using the `@tech-stack-provisioner` handle.

## Tech Stack Updates

All Tech Stack changes must now be submitted using the **[Tech Stack Update Form](https://app.serval.com/new-request)** in Compass.

### How to Submit a Tech Stack Update Request

1. Go to **Compass → New Request → Service Catalog → Tech Stack Update**
2. In Compass, open the **[Tech Stack Update form](https://app.serval.com/new-request)** under the Service Catalog section.
3. Once the form loads, select the relevant option under **“What can we help you with?”**
   The applicable follow-up questions will automatically appear.

4. Fill in all required details and submit the request.

### Processing & Workflow

- All requests will be routed through Compass.
- The **Corporate IT Team / IT EntApps Team** will review, validate, and update entries accordingly.
- Ownership roles remain unchanged — you will still identify the Business Owner, Technical Owner, and Provisioners for each system.

### **What data lives in the Tech Stack?**

### Adding a New System to the Tech Stack

The process for adding a new system to the tech stack has fully moved to Compass. Instead of creating a merge request in the `tech_stack.yml` file, follow the process below:

1. Go to **Compass → New Request → Service Catalog → Tech Stack Update [Tech Stack Update](https://app.serval.com/new-request)**
   *(Okta path: Okta → Compass → New Request → Service Catalog → Tech Stack Update)*

2. Open the form and select **Add a New System**.
   The form will automatically display all required fields such as system description, ownership, provisioners, access details, data classification, and other relevant attributes.

3. Fill out the details and submit the request.

> **Note:** Legal, IT Compliance, Internal Audit, Security Risk, and Business Systems will be automatically involved in the workflow to complete their respective sections before the request is finalized.

### Updating an Existing System in Tech Stack

All system updates must now be made through Compass. Instead of creating a merge request in the `tech_stack.yml` file, follow the process below:

1. Navigate to **Compass → IT → [Tech Stack Update](https://app.serval.com/new-request)** and select **Update an Existing System**.
2. Choose the system you want to modify.
3. The form will automatically display follow-up questions based on the type of update.
4. Provide the necessary changes and submit the form.

The appropriate reviewer groups will validate and process the update as part of the Compass workflow.

### Removing a System from Tech Stack

To remove a system from the tech stack, use the [Tech Stack Update](https://app.serval.com/new-request) form instead of submitting a merge request to the `tech_stack.yml` file.

1. Go to **Compass → IT → [Tech Stack Update](https://app.serval.com/new-request)** and select **Remove a System**.
2. Provide context for the deprecation or offboarding, along with any required details to initiate the process.
3. As part of this workflow, the **Business Owner** must coordinate with **Legal** and **IT Compliance** to ensure data deletion and contractual requirements are fully addressed.
4. Once all steps are completed and verified, the **Compass Team / EntApps Team** will remove the system from the tech stack.

Occasionally, systems listed in our tech stack will be deprecated. If a system is being offboarded (no longer used or being replaced), please submit a Remove a System request through the [Tech Stack Update](https://app.serval.com/new-request) workflow in Compass.

As part of this process, the Business Owner must collaborate with Legal and IT Compliance to ensure that all data deletion and contractual requirements are completed according to the vendor agreement. Once all steps are validated, the system will be removed from the Tech Stack through the Compass workflow.

### Updating the Offboarding Templates

The offboarding templates need to be updated when a new system is added to the Tech Stack in order for GitLab to be compliant and remove Team Members from systems once they leave GitLab. There are two different ways to update the offboarding templates.  Pick the option which best suits the usage of the new system. Once the MR is ready to be merged, tag the People Operations team - `@gl-people-ops-team` - for approval and merge.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Option 1: New system used by all/many Team Members, across multiple departments</summary>

Update the [main Team Member Offboarding](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding.md) template.

The main template is divided into two sections.  The first section is the [Offboarding Tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding.md#offboarding-tasks) section.  This section is applicable to all GitLab Team Members and is performed by the Manager, People, Business Technology, and Finance/Accounting teams.

The second section is the [Tech Stack System Deprovisioning / Offboarding](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding.md#tech-stack-system-deprovisioning-offboarding-tasks-that-need-to-be-completed-within-5-days) section.  Update this section with the new system being added to the Tech Stack.  Use the format below to make the update:

```markdown
## Department that owns the new system. If new system is owned by multiple departments, list the department the main deprovisioner belongs to. Please make sure the department does not already exist within the template. If it does, ignore this header and just add the following information underneath the existing department header

#### <summary>Name of deprovisioner @usernameofdeprovisioner, Name of deprovisioner 2 @usernameofdeprovisioner2, etc. </summary>

<table >
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td> `System name`  </td>
   <td>

- [ ] Access Deprovisioned - System name
- [ ] Not Applicable to Team Member - System name

</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
```

When finished, link the MR in the "Access Tasks" section of the 'Tech Stack - Add New System' MR.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Option 2: New system used by a limited number of Team Members, all in SAME department</summary>

Update the [department-level Offboarding template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/employment-templates/-/tree/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding_tasks) within this directory.

Using the link above, locate the template of the department owning the new system and update it. Example: If only the Security team will have access to a new system, locate the [Security template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding_tasks/department_security.md) and add the new system to that template following this format:

`- [ ]  @usernameofdeprovisioner @usernameofdeprovisioner2: Remove the team member from System name`

When finished, link the MR in the "Access Tasks" section of the 'Tech Stack - Add New System' MR.
</details>

### Exceptions

There are exceptions to adding technologies to the Tech Stack which are handled on a case-by-case basis.
